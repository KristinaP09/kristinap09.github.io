  <h1>I Predicted This Chaos, and Now I’m Sipping Tea While the System Auto-Completes Itself</h1>

  <p>
    There was a time — not too long ago — when people looked at me sideways for saying 
    <em>“soon, everyone will code without needing a software engineering degree.”</em> They called it idealistic. 
    Naïve. A little too caffeinated.

  <p>
    Fast forward to today, and GitHub Copilot is basically the unpaid intern of every developer. 
    Scratch that — it’s the overachieving intern who never sleeps, types faster than you think, and doesn’t ask for vacation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Code used to be sacred, guarded by the high priests of CS degrees and gatekeeping interviews. Now? A philosophy major 
    is spinning up Flask apps, a high schooler is building bots on Replit, and I’m sitting here sipping tea, watching the chaos 
    unfold like I ordered it from a menu.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the best part? I called it. I said this was coming. They laughed. Now they’re Googling 
    <code>how to prompt an AI like a pro</code> while secretly asking ChatGPT to debug their code.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Welcome to the future — it autocompletes itself.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Democratization of Code, or: “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let the Algorithm Cook”</h2>

  <p>
    Let’s take a stroll through this brave new world, shall we?
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember when software engineers proudly told you how they memorized sorting algorithms, built linked lists from scratch, 
    and wrestled with pointers until 2 a.m.? Now we have full-stack apps built with a single sentence:  
    <em>“Make me a website that sells existential dread as a subscription service.”</em>
    And guess what? It ships. In React. With Tailwind. And probably dark mode, because obviously.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, recruiters are still writing job descriptions like:  
    <code>Must have 10 years of experience in a language that came out last Tuesday.</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Out in the wild, you’ve got a 13-year-old on TikTok deploying Python bots that auto-like your cat photos. A retiree is 
    generating SQL queries with ChatGPT to analyze bird migration. And somewhere in Silicon Valley, an ex-coffee shop poet just 
    became a "Prompt Engineer" with a six-figure salary for typing glorified wishes into a text box.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the best part?  
    The old guard still insists: <em>“Real coders use Vim.”</em>  
    Yes, Greg. And real writers only use typewriters, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't the fall of software engineering — it's rebranding. Less gatekeeping, more imagination. 
    You no longer need to <em>be</em> the machine; you just need to know how to <em>talk</em> to it. 
    And if that threatens someone’s identity? Well… maybe their career was a script away from obsolescence anyway.
  </p>

  <h2>So, What Now?</h2>

  <p>
    Now that the code gates have been kicked open and the sacred scrolls of Stack Overflow have been digitized into chatbots, 
    what’s left?
  </p>

  <p>
    Imagination. Curiosity. A bit of sass.  
    In a world where the AI writes the boilerplate, your job is to ask better questions — or at least ask them with flair. 
    The future belongs to those who can <em>vibe with the machine</em> while sipping something warm and judging the chaos 
    like it’s reality TV.
  </p>

  <p>
    So if you're still out here clinging to your Git workflow like it’s a holy relic, or panicking because your neighbor just 
    built a game with zero background in computer science — breathe. You’re witnessing evolution. Or revolution. 
    Or maybe just a cosmic joke with good UX.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Either way, it's your move.  
    <br>
    <strong>Open the terminal. Type a sentence. Let Copilot cook.</strong>  
    <br>
    And if it breaks? Just blame the AI — that’s what we all do now.
