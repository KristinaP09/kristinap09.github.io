<h2>🤡 Clown Network Chronicles</h2>

<p><strong>Welcome to the world of involuntary circus psychology.  </strong> <br><br>
This section documents my long-running observation of a mysterious syndicate I’ve dubbed <em>“The Clown Network.”</em> <br> 
No, it’s not a joke. Yes, they are allegedly human. No, they don’t knock.</p>

<p>Operating mainly from upstairs apartments and the corners of dreams, these performers specialize in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Midnight chair-dragging rituals </li> 
  <li>Psychological manipulation via amateur acoustics </li> 
  <li>Noise-fueled behavior mapping (uninvited)  </li>
  <li>Being both deaf and loud — simultaneously </li> 
</ul>

<p>While most researchers seek funding for <em>controlled</em> experiments, these clowns cut out the middleman (ethics committees). <br><br> 
Consider this my attempt at documenting what happens when the circus forgets to pack up and leave your ceiling.</p>
