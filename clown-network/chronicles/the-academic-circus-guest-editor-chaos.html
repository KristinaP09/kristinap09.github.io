                <p>First, we have Mrs. Maria Jaranowska, Assistant Editor, who's apparently <em>very concerned</em> about the quality of peer review. Her complaint? My review was too good, too fast, and therefore must be AI-generated. Here's her actual email:</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📧 The Complaint Email</h3>
                    <p><em>"In a recent quality check, we noticed that your review report might have been generated, translated, or polished using AI tools."</em></p>
                    <p>Translation: <strong>"Your review was better than what we usually get, so obviously it's fake."</strong></p>
                    <p>The irony? She's complaining about AI while demonstrating exactly why AI might be an improvement over human incompetence.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Classic move—avoid conflict, throw some blame around, and, of course, pretend it was all part of the plan. Oh, and let's not forget how they violate reviewer restrictions while acting like they've got it all together.</p>

                <h3>Exhibit B: The Random Guest Editor Invitation</h3>

                <p>But wait, there's more! From the same publisher (MDPI), but a different journal, comes Ms. April Mu with this gem:</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📧 The "Trust" Email</h3>
                    <p><em>"We fully trust you to lead this Special Issue independently. However, due to the guidelines, we recommend at least two senior scholars to co-edit..."</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Translation:</strong> <em>"We have no idea who you are, but please find your own co-editors because we couldn't be bothered to properly vet this process."</em></p>
                    <p>Classic MDPI: "We trust you completely! Now please do our job for us."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    Honestly, if I were that guest editor, I'd be thinking: "I might need retraining… or maybe I'm just a pawn in their messed-up system."

                        <li><strong>Ms. April:</strong> "We trust you completely!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Also Ms. April:</strong> "Please do our job for us and find your own team"</li>

                        <li><strong>MDPI Logic:</strong> Complain about AI quality while proving human incompetence</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The assistant editor is literally complaining about AI while providing a masterclass in why AI might be necessary. Meanwhile, another editor from the same publisher is asking guest editors to self-organize because they can't be bothered with actual editorial oversight. <em>And now Dr. Sorina is editing reviews without permission then asking for retroactive approval!</em></p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    "Your review is too good and too fast, it must be artificial intelligence!"

                </div>

                <h3>The Guest Editor's Dilemma</h3>

                <p>Picture this: You're invited to be a guest editor. You think it's because of your expertise, your reputation, your carefully built academic credibility. You prepare thoughtfully, review the guidelines, take the responsibility seriously.</p>

                <p>Then you discover you were just... <em>picked at random</em>.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "Wait, was I selected for my qualifications, or am I just a random name pulled from a hat? Do I need retraining, or is this entire system completely broken?"

                </div>

                <p>The beautiful irony? The guest editor starts questioning <em>themselves</em> instead of the system. Classic institutional gaslighting at its finest.</p>

                <h3>Plot Twist: Enter Dr. Sorina Mihaela Bogdan</h3>

                <p>Just when you think this circus can't get more entertaining, <strong>Dr. Sorina Mihaela Bogdan</strong> enters the ring! This morning's email brings us a fresh dose of MDPI magic:</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📧 The Latest Circus Email</h3>
                    <p><em>"The review report for the manuscript drones-3795168 has been updated by internal editor, Sorina Mihaela Bogdan. Please ensure that all changes were made appropriately."</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "I changed your work without permission, now make sure you approve of my unauthorized edits."</p>
                    <p>The audacity is <em>chef's kiss</em> perfect. She modified the review, then asks the original reviewer to "ensure all changes were made appropriately." Because nothing says professional like retroactive permission requests!</p>
                </div>

                <p>But here's the <span class="dysfunction-highlight">delicious irony</span>: Dr. Bogdan has a PhD but isn't affiliated with any university or research institution. She's essentially a freelance editor telling actual researchers how to do their work. <strong>The confidence is breathtaking!</strong></p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">

                <p>The response? <strong>Complete radio silence.</strong> No clicking the link, no engaging with the circus. Sometimes the most professional response to institutional chaos is dignified indifference.</p>

                <h3>Plot Twist Continues: The MDPI IoT Journal Review Disaster</h3>

                <p>But wait, there's more from the MDPI circus! Fresh evidence of how <em>not</em> to run a review process comes straight from their IoT journal. Buckle up for a masterclass in review process dysfunction that spans multiple revision rounds.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🎪 The IoT Journal Saga: A Three-Act Tragedy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Act I:</strong> Comprehensive review provided with 8 detailed improvement points</p>
                    <p><strong>Act II:</strong> Authors respond, major revision requested again</p>
                    <p><strong>Act III:</strong> Reviewer demands professional communication standards</p>
                    <p><em>The ending? Complete withdrawal from the process.</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>This isn't just regular dysfunction — this is <span class="dysfunction-highlight">systematic review process failure</span> documented in real-time. The reviewer provided detailed, constructive feedback across multiple rounds, only to be met with persistent communication issues and process violations.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "Professional communication standards notice: Future review participation is contingent upon establishing appropriate professional communication protocols and standards in the editorial process."
                    <div class="quote-attribution">— When reviewers have had enough</div>
                </div>

                <p>Here's what makes this particularly delicious: The reviewer documented <em>everything</em>. Initial assessment, detailed review points, editorial recommendations, author responses, second round comments — a complete record of how MDPI IoT manages to turn a scholarly review process into an endurance test of professional patience.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📝 The Review Process Breakdown</h3>
                    <p><strong>What the reviewer provided:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comprehensive manuscript assessment with identified gaps</li>
                        <li>Eight priority improvement points with detailed explanations</li>
                        <li>Global editorial recommendation with practical suggestions</li>
                        <li>Second round assessment after author revisions</li>
                        <li>Specific formatting and reference management guidance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What MDPI IoT provided:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Persistent communication issues</li>
                        <li>Process violations</li>
                        <li>Failure to address reviewer concerns</li>
                        <li>Unprofessional editorial standards</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The beautiful irony? The reviewer was so thorough they created a complete documentation of the process failure. It reads like an anthropological study of institutional dysfunction — complete with timestamps, detailed feedback, and a final professional withdrawal when standards couldn't be maintained.</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    When your review process is so broken that the reviewer creates a comprehensive notebook documenting the dysfunction, you've achieved a special level of editorial failure.
                </div>

                <p>And the final statement? <strong>"I will reconsider to review after the professional communication style has been made."</strong> Translation: "Fix your process, then we'll talk."</p>

                <p>This is what happens when institutional chaos meets professional standards. The professional response isn't angry confrontation — it's documented withdrawal with clear conditions for re-engagement. <em>Chef's kiss</em> perfect.</p>

                <h2>Deep Dive: The MDPI IoT Journal Masterclass in Review Process Destruction</h2>

                <p>The MDPI IoT journal deserves special recognition for creating what might be the most <span class="dysfunction-highlight">thoroughly documented review process failure</span> in academic publishing history. This isn't just dysfunction — it's <em>artisanal dysfunction</em>, carefully crafted over multiple revision rounds.</p>

                <h3>The IoT Journal's Greatest Hits</h3>

                <p>What makes the IoT journal particularly special is their ability to take a <strong>comprehensive, detailed review process</strong> and transform it into a test of human patience. They've managed to weaponize the revision process itself!</p>

                <h3>The IoT Review Process: A Case Study in Institutional Gaslighting</h3>

                <p>Let's break down the IoT journal's <em>innovative approach</em> to reviewer management:</p>

                <div class="process-breakdown">

                    </div>

                        <div class="process-step-icon">🔄</div>
                        <h4>Authors Respond</h4>

                        <p>Reviewer provides additional detailed feedback, notes persistent issues</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <div class="process-step-icon">🚫</div>
                        <h4>Professional Standards Notice</h4>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The beauty of this system? <strong>The IoT journal managed to convert expert knowledge into a comprehensive documentation of their own dysfunction.</strong> Every round of review became additional evidence of their inability to maintain professional standards.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "We've created a review process so broken that qualified reviewers document our failures as they exit. It's like performance art, but unintentional!"
                    <div class="quote-attribution">— IoT Journal's accidental mission statement</div>
                </div>

                <h3>The IoT Innovation: Reviewer Documentation As Service</h3>

                <p>Here's what's particularly brilliant about the IoT journal's approach: they've essentially <em>outsourced the documentation of their own incompetence</em> to their reviewers. Instead of maintaining professional standards themselves, they've created a system where qualified reviewers do the work of documenting exactly why the process is broken.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📊 The IoT Efficiency Model</h3>
                    <p><strong>Traditional Approach:</strong> Journal maintains quality control internally</p>
                    <p><strong>IoT Innovation:</strong> Reviewers document quality control failures externally</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Comprehensive failure analysis created by unpaid experts</p>
                    <p><em>It's crowdsourced institutional criticism!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>Think about the efficiency: instead of hiring competent editorial staff, they've created a system where <span class="dysfunction-highlight">professional reviewers voluntarily create detailed reports on exactly what's wrong with their process</span>. It's like getting free consulting on your institutional failures!</p>

                <h3>The IoT Communication Style: A Linguistic Study</h3>

                <p>The IoT journal has developed what we might call a <em>unique communication style</em> that seems specifically designed to test the limits of professional patience. It's like they've created a new dialect of academic discourse — one that speaks fluent dysfunction.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🗣️ The IoT Communication Patterns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Selective Comprehension:</strong> Ignoring key reviewer concerns while responding to trivial ones</li>
                        <li><strong>Revision Deflection:</strong> Requesting more rounds instead of addressing core issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Violation Normalization:</strong> Treating unprofessional behavior as standard procedure</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation Resistance:</strong> Avoiding clear, professional communication protocols</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The most impressive part? They've managed to maintain this communication style <strong>consistently across multiple revision rounds</strong>. That takes real commitment to dysfunction!</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    The IoT journal has achieved something remarkable: they've made professional withdrawal feel like a service to the academic community. When leaving their review process feels like a public good, you've reached peak institutional dysfunction.
                </div>

                <h3>The IoT Legacy: A Template for What Not to Do</h3>

                <p>Perhaps the IoT journal's greatest contribution to academic publishing is providing a <em>comprehensive template</em> for how not to run a review process. Every violation, every communication failure, every boundary crossed has been carefully documented by their reviewers.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📚 The IoT Educational Contribution</h3>
                    <p><strong>For Future Editors:</strong> A complete guide to review process failures</p>
                    <p><strong>For Reviewers:</strong> Clear examples of when to withdraw professionally</p>
                    <p><strong>For Authors:</strong> What not to expect from quality journals</p>
                    <p><strong>For Academia:</strong> A case study in institutional dysfunction</p>
                    <p><em>They've accidentally created the most comprehensive negative example in academic publishing!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The beautiful irony? <strong>The IoT journal's failure has become more educationally valuable than many of their successful publications.</strong> Their dysfunction documentation will probably have more long-term impact on academic publishing standards than their actual research content.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "We tried to publish academic research, but accidentally created a masterpiece of institutional criticism instead. Our review process failure documentation will be cited for years!"

                </div>

                <h3>The IoT Economics: Vouchers vs. Professional Dignity</h3>

                <p>But here's the <em>cherry on top</em> of this dysfunction sundae: MDPI typically offers reviewers a voucher ranging from 50 to 100 euros once the review process is finalized and the manuscript is prepared for publication. <strong>Because nothing says "we value your expertise" like a discount coupon after putting you through institutional hell!</strong></p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>💰 The MDPI Value Proposition</h3>
                    <p><strong>What you provide:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Professional expertise and reputation</li>
                        <li>Comprehensive review documentation</li>
                        <li>Multiple rounds of detailed feedback</li>
                        <li>Patience through dysfunctional processes</li>
                        <li>Free consulting on their institutional failures</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>50-100 euro voucher (if you survive the process)</li>
                        <li>Documented evidence of institutional dysfunction</li>
                        <li>A masterclass in professional boundary violations</li>
                        <li>Educational content about what not to tolerate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>What a bargain!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The beautiful irony? <span class="dysfunction-highlight">Most qualified reviewers find this voucher system irrelevant.</span> When you're dealing with systematic professional boundary violations, communication failures, and institutional gaslighting, a discount coupon feels less like compensation and more like... <em>insult to injury</em>.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "We'll put you through multiple rounds of institutional dysfunction, violate professional standards, ignore your feedback, and then give you a 75-euro voucher! Surely this compensates for the damage to your professional experience!"
                    <div class="quote-attribution">— MDPI's value calculation</div>
                </div>

                <p>Think about the economics here: They're essentially saying that <strong>professional dignity has a market value of 50-100 euros.</strong> It's like they've created a price list for tolerating institutional incompetence!</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    MDPI has solved the age-old question: "What's the going rate for professional self-respect?" Apparently, it's somewhere between a nice dinner and a decent pair of shoes.
                </div>

                <p>The most delicious part? The voucher is only provided <em>once the manuscript is prepared for publication</em> — meaning you have to endure their entire dysfunctional process, watch them publish potentially substandard work, and THEN get your discount coupon. It's like a loyalty program for institutional masochism!</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🎟️ The MDPI Reviewer Rewards Program</h3>
                    <p><strong>Bronze Level:</strong> Survive one round of dysfunction → 50 euro voucher</p>

                    <p><strong>Gold Level:</strong> Document complete process failure → 100 euro voucher</p>
                    <p><strong>Platinum Level:</strong> Professional withdrawal with evidence → Priceless dignity</p>
                    <p><em>Guess which level most qualified reviewers choose?</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Systemic Dysfunction Pattern: A Scientific Analysis</h3>

                <p>What we're witnessing isn't random incompetence — it's <span class="dysfunction-highlight">systematic institutional failure</span> with reproducible patterns. Like a well-designed experiment, MDPI has created a controlled environment where professional standards go to die.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🔬 The MDPI Dysfunction Formula</h3>
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Invite experts (randomly selected)</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Violate established protocols</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Gaslight when questioned</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Blame the expert for being "too professional"</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Repeat with next victim</p>
                    <p><em>It's like a recipe for institutional chaos — and they've perfected it!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The beautiful consistency is breathtaking. Whether it's Maria complaining about quality, April delegating responsibility, Sorina editing without permission, or the IoT team turning reviews into endurance tests — they all follow the <strong>same playbook</strong>.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "We've created a system so dysfunctional that it produces consistent results: professional reviewers walking away with documented evidence of our incompetence."
                    <div class="quote-attribution">— MDPI's unintentional mission statement</div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Academic Reputation Destruction Machine</h3>

                <p>Here's what's particularly fascinating: <em>MDPI has industrialized the process of alienating qualified reviewers.</em> It's not accidental incompetence — it's a well-oiled machine designed to turn professional expertise into documented dysfunction.</p>

                <div class="process-breakdown">
                    <div class="process-step">

                        <h4>Output: Professional Exit</h4>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The efficiency is remarkable. They've managed to create a system that converts professional expertise into institutional embarrassment with <span class="dysfunction-highlight">100% reproducibility</span>.</p>

                <h3>The Documentation Trail: Evidence Collection</h3>

                <p>What makes this particularly delicious is how <strong>thoroughly documented</strong> everything is. Every email, every violation, every professional boundary crossed — it's all preserved for posterity.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📁 The MDPI Evidence Archive</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maria's AI Paranoia:</strong> "Quality is suspicious" emails</li>
                        <li><strong>April's Delegation Strategy:</strong> "Trust us, do our job" communications</li>
                        <li><strong>Sorina's Edit-First-Ask-Later:</strong> Unauthorized modification notifications</li>

                    <p><em>It's like they're building their own museum of professional dysfunction!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The irony? <strong>They're creating the evidence that demonstrates exactly why serious academics should avoid their journals.</strong> Every email, every violation, every gaslighting attempt becomes part of the permanent record.</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    MDPI has solved the problem of academic credibility by providing comprehensive documentation of why they lack it. It's almost efficient!
                </div>

                <h3>The Reviewer Psychology Experiment</h3>

                <p>From a behavioral science perspective, this is fascinating. MDPI has essentially created a <em>natural experiment</em> in how professional standards interact with institutional chaos.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🧠 The Behavioral Study Results</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Professional reviewers will tolerate unlimited dysfunction</p>
                    <p><strong>Method:</strong> Apply systematic violation of professional standards</p>
                    <p><strong>Results:</strong> Reviewers document dysfunction and withdraw</p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Professional standards are non-negotiable</p>
                    <p><em>Who knew that treating experts professionally was actually important?</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The most interesting finding? <span class="dysfunction-highlight">Professional reviewers don't just quit — they create comprehensive documentation of why they're quitting.</span> It's like MDPI has accidentally funded a research project into their own institutional failures.</p>

                <h3>The Ecosystem Impact: Academic Natural Selection</h3>

                <p>Here's the beautiful irony: <strong>MDPI is actually performing a valuable service for the academic community.</strong> They're creating a natural selection pressure that helps identify journals worth avoiding!</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🌍 The Academic Ecosystem Effect</h3>
                    <p><strong>Before MDPI:</strong> Hard to identify problematic journals</p>
                    <p><strong>After MDPI:</strong> Clear behavioral patterns documented</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Professional standards become visible through contrast</p>
                    <p><em>They've become the control group in academic publishing!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>Think about it: every documented case of dysfunction makes it easier for future reviewers to recognize red flags. Maria's AI paranoia, April's delegation strategy, Sorina's edit-first-ask-later approach — they're all becoming <span class="dysfunction-highlight">teachable moments</span> in professional standards.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "Thank you, MDPI, for showing us exactly what professional academic publishing should NOT look like. Your comprehensive demonstration of dysfunction serves as an excellent negative example."

                </div>

                <h3>The Institutional Learning Opportunity</h3>

                <p>What's particularly fascinating is how MDPI's dysfunction creates <em>educational content</em> for the rest of the academic world. Every violation, every gaslighting attempt, every professional boundary crossed becomes a case study in what not to do.</p>

                <div class="process-breakdown">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>It's like MDPI is running a <strong>masterclass in editorial malpractice</strong> — complete with documented examples, email evidence, and reproducible results. The academic community should probably send them a thank-you note!</p>

                <h3>The Professional Standards Laboratory</h3>

                <p>From a systems perspective, MDPI has created something remarkable: a controlled environment where we can observe what happens when professional standards are systematically violated. It's like a <em>behavioral laboratory</em> for academic publishing ethics.</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>🔬 Laboratory Conditions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Variable:</strong> Level of professional dysfunction</p>
                    <p><strong>Control:</strong> Qualified reviewers with standards</p>
                    <p><strong>Observations:</strong> Systematic documentation and withdrawal</p>
                    <p><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> 100% across multiple test subjects</p>
                    <p><em>The results are remarkably consistent!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The experimental design is actually quite elegant: Take professional reviewers, apply systematic dysfunction, measure the response. The fact that <span class="dysfunction-highlight">every qualified reviewer reaches the same conclusion</span> suggests this isn't about individual preferences — it's about fundamental professional standards.</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    MDPI has accidentally created the most comprehensive study of professional tolerance limits in academic publishing. The data strongly suggests that competent reviewers have consistent standards — who knew?

                <h3>The Final Irony: Being Faulted by the Flawed</h3>

                <p>And here we find ourselves again — <span class="dysfunction-highlight">being faulted by their flawed system</span>. What a life indeed! The beautiful, cosmic joke of it all: a broken institution criticizing the very people who could fix it.</p>

                <div class="chaos-quote">
                    "Here we are, professional experts being lectured about standards by an institution that has systematically demonstrated it has none. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife!"
                    <div class="quote-attribution">— The eternal academic comedy</div>
                </div>

                <p>It's like being criticized for your driving by someone who's actively crashing their car. <strong>The audacity is breathtaking, but the comedy is priceless.</strong></p>

                    <h3>🎭 The Eternal Academic Comedy</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Setup:</strong> Qualified professionals offer expertise</p>
                    <p><strong>The Twist:</strong> Broken system finds them inadequate</p>
                    <p><strong>The Punchline:</strong> System demonstrates why it's broken</p>
                    <p><strong>The Encore:</strong> Professionals document the absurdity</p>
                    <p><em>And the show goes on!</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>At this point, it's almost <em>performance art</em>. MDPI has created a self-sustaining cycle of institutional dysfunction that generates its own entertainment value. Every email, every violation, every gaslighting attempt just adds to the comedy gold.</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    "What a life indeed!" — When institutional dysfunction becomes so predictable that it's actually funny. We're not trapped in their system; we're watching a comedy show with front-row seats!
                </div>

                <p><strong>The most beautiful part?</strong> We get to laugh at the absurdity while maintaining our professional dignity. They get to continue their circus while we document it for posterity. <em>Everybody wins!</em> (Well, except for their reputation, but that ship sailed long ago.)</p>

                <h3>The Assistant Editor vs. AI Showdown</h3>

                <p>Let's be honest here: <strong>Mrs. Maria is essentially admitting that AI produces better reviews than her usual reviewers.</strong> Think about it:</p>

                        <li>Grammar and formatting issues</li>
                        <li>Slow delivery</li>
                        <li>Incomplete analysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>So... who's the problem again?</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>The beautiful irony? She's basically advertising for AI while trying to complain about it. <span class="dysfunction-highlight">"This review is too good, therefore it must be fake!"</span> is not the flex she thinks it is.</p>

                <h3>The Ultimate Irony: Quality Control</h3>

                <p>But here's the <em>real</em> kicker that Mrs. Maria completely missed:</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    What AI provides is not published or pushed without my acceptance. In other words, <strong>AI is smarter than her.</strong>
                </div>

                <p>Think about this logic:</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📊 Quality Control Comparison</h3>
                    <p><strong>AI-Assisted Review Process:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI generates content</li>
                        <li><strong>Human reviews and approves</strong></li>
                        <li>Human takes responsibility</li>
                        <li>Quality control at every step</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Maria's Editorial Process:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maria generates complaints</li>
                        <li><strong>No quality control</strong></li>
                        <li>Published immediately</li>
                        <li>Demonstrates incompetence publicly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>Spot the difference?</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>So let me get this straight: AI-generated content requires human oversight and approval before publication, but <span class="dysfunction-highlight">Maria's natural stupidity gets published without any quality control whatsoever?</span></p>

                <p>That's right — <strong>AI has better quality control than MDPI's editorial process.</strong> At least AI waits for approval before publishing nonsense.</p>

                <h3>The Plot Thickens: The ORCID Revelation</h3>

                <p>But wait, it gets even <em>more</em> ridiculous. Here's the timeline of events that Mrs. Maria apparently didn't think through:</p>

                <div class="circus-box">
                    <h3>📅 The Actual Timeline</h3>
                    <ol style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li><strong>Review submitted</strong> → High quality, well-structured</li>
                        <li><strong>Review accepted by MDPI system</strong> → Automatically processed</li>
                        <li><strong>System validates review quality</strong> → Meets journal standards</li>
                        <li><strong>Reviewer deposits credits to ORCID</strong> → System allows it (confirming quality)</li>
                        <li><strong>THEN Maria complains</strong> → "This might be AI-generated!"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><em>She sent the complaint email AFTER the reviewer had already deposited credits to their ORCID account using MDPI's own system validation.</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>Wait, let that sink in. The MDPI system itself allowed the reviewer to deposit credits to their ORCID account — this isn't manual, it's automated validation that the review met their standards. Maria is literally complaining about work that her own journal's system had already approved and credited.</p>

                <p>So let's recap this beautiful chaos:</p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    Maria accepted, processed, and officially credited a review through MDPI's automated system — which validates quality before allowing ORCID deposits — then complained it was "AI-generated." She's either admitting she doesn't understand her own journal's validation system, or she's complaining about work the system itself confirmed was legitimate.
                </div>

                <p>This raises some <em>delicious</em> questions:</p>

                <div class="chaos-list">
                    <h4>Questions Maria Can't Answer:</h4>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Why did your system allow ORCID crediting for "suspicious" work?</span>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Do you not understand how your own validation process works?</span>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Are you admitting the system approved "AI-generated" content?</span>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Why complain about work your system already validated?</span>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Is this a quality control failure or comprehension failure?</span>
                    <span class="chaos-item">Do you routinely dispute your own system's decisions?</span>
                </div>

                <p>The most charitable interpretation? <strong>Maria doesn't actually read the reviews before processing them.</strong> The less charitable interpretation? <span class="dysfunction-highlight">She processed work she knew was high quality, then complained about it being "too good" because that's suspicious.</span></p>

                <h3>The Institutional Comedy</h3>

                <p>What makes this particularly delicious is the <em>audacity</em>. They violate their own reviewer restrictions while simultaneously acting like paragons of academic integrity. They throw together a random selection process and then present it with the gravitas of a Supreme Court nomination.</p>

                <p>It's performance art, really. <span class="dysfunction-highlight">Institutional dysfunction as theater.</span></p>

                <div class="irony-callout">
                    The most beautiful part? They genuinely believe their own performance. It's method acting taken to its logical extreme — they've become the character so completely, they've forgotten it's a role.
                </div>

                <h3>Respect for the Chaos</h3>

                <p>And honestly? There's something almost <em>admirable</em> about the sheer commitment to dysfunction. It takes real dedication to maintain this level of institutional chaos while keeping a straight face.</p>

                <p>They've created a system so beautifully broken that it functions purely on momentum and collective delusion. It's like watching a Rube Goldberg machine made entirely of academic bureaucracy and professional incompetence.</p>

                    <h3>🎪 The Circus Rules</h3>
                    <p>In the Academic Circus, the traditional rules don't apply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Randomness = Strategy</li>
                        <li>Violations = Flexibility</li>
                        <li>Chaos = Sophistication</li>
                        <li>Gaslighting = Process Clarification</li>
                        <li>Dysfunction = Innovation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Welcome to the show!</strong> Leave your logic at the door.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="conclusion-chaos">
                    <p><em>So here's to Mrs. Maria Jaranowska, Ms. April Mu, Dr. Sorina Mihaela Bogdan, and the entire MDPI IoT editorial team — a constellation of dysfunction that defies explanation.</em></p>
                    <p>May Maria continue to complain about quality while demonstrating incompetence, may April continue to "trust completely" while delegating everything, may Dr. Sorina keep editing work without permission then asking for retroactive approval, and may the IoT journal continue turning thorough reviews into endurance tests of professional patience.</p>
                    <p><em>It's performance art for the academic age — documented dysfunction as educational content.</em></p>
                    <p><em>And honestly? The professional response to this circus is dignified withdrawal with documented evidence.</em></p>
                    <p>Sometimes creating a comprehensive record of institutional failure is the most eloquent reply of all.</p>

                <h3>🎭 The Show Must Go On</h3>
                <p>For every reviewer wondering if their work is "too good" — it's not. The system's standards are just that low.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the most professional response to institutional chaos is to laugh at the absurdity — or ignore it entirely.</p>
                <div class="irony-callout" style="margin: 1.5rem 0; background: var(--gradient-circus); color: white;">
                    🎪 Welcome to MDPI's Academic Circus — where quality is suspicious, unauthorized edits are normal, multiple revision rounds are standard, and chaos is procedure! 🎪
                </div>
                <p>Remember: When editors modify your work without permission then ask for approval, or when journals turn comprehensive reviews into endurance tests, you're not the problem. The system is.</p>
                <p>P.S. To Dr. Sorina and the IoT editorial team: Thanks for demonstrating that sometimes the most eloquent response is complete withdrawal with documented evidence. Professional standards matter, and when they're absent, walking away with dignity is the appropriate response.</p>
