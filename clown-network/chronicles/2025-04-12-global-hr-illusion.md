<em> When HR says ‘We care about your wellbeing’—and hands you a stress ball while ignoring your burnout, gaslighting your feedback, and planning the next team-building bingo night.</em>
</p>


<p align="justify">Welcome to the world of Human Resources—where “people-first” is a tagline, not a practice. Where policies are plentiful, but actual humanity is… well, lost somewhere between the diversity dashboard and the sixth compliance training this quarter.</p>

<p align="justify">Let’s break it down, shall we?</p>

<h2>HR: The Department of Performative Caring</h2>

<p align="justify">They say, <em>“We’re here for you.”</em><br>
Translation: <em>“We’re here for the company, and maybe for you if your feelings fit into our pre-approved empathy matrix.”</em></p>

<p align="justify">From pastel wellness posters to awkward team-building icebreakers, HR departments around the world have mastered the art of <strong>looking concerned while doing nothing of real value</strong>.</p>

<p align="justify">Need support with a toxic manager?<br>
Here’s a mindfulness workshop.</p>

<p align="justify">Burnt out and overworked?<br>
Try yoga on Wednesdays. (Don’t forget to clock out first.)</p>

<h2>The Feedback Illusion</h2>

<p align="justify"><em>“We value your input!”</em><br>
Ah yes, the sacred feedback survey—where anonymous voices go to be ignored in a structured format.</p>

<p align="justify">You clicked 1 out of 5 on “Do you feel heard?” and they responded with… a new question:<br>
<strong>“Have you considered feeling heard?”</strong></p>

<h2>HR in Developed Countries: Fancier Fonts, Same Fools</h2>

<p align="justify">Just because the office has a nap pod doesn’t mean the HR team has evolved.</p>

<p align="justify">They still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect bad leadership</li>
<li>Disguise corporate gaslighting as “culture alignment”</li>
<li>Call resignations a “learning opportunity” while quietly cheering attrition metrics</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Only difference? They’ve got better LinkedIn profiles and pronounce “resilience” with a TED Talk smile.</p>

<h2>The Real Job Description</h2>

<p align="justify">Despite the name, HR isn’t about <em>humans</em>—it’s about <em>resources</em>.<br>
People are processed, categorized, and filed like company assets. You're not John from Accounting. You're "FTE 1037.2 with mobility potential."</p>

<p align="justify">And if you dare ask real questions about fairness, ethics, or policy clarity?<br>
Congratulations—you’ve just been invited to a meeting with Legal.</p>

<h2>In Summary:</h2>

<p align="justify">HR is often the department that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tells you to speak up, then punishes you for doing so</li>
<li>Preaches psychological safety, then tracks your keystrokes</li>
<li>Celebrates “mental health month” by giving you a stress ball and zero schedule flexibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what do we do?</h2>

<p align="justify">We stop pretending.</p>

<p align="justify">We stop mistaking PR for protection, and posters for people skills.</p>

<p align="justify">We call it what it is: a system that was supposed to be the bridge between employee and employer, but somewhere along the way decided to become a really polished wall.</p>

<p align="justify"><em>And if you're an HR professional reading this and thinking, “Not all HR is like this”…</em></p>

<p align="justify">Congratulations.<br>
You’ve just won the <strong>“I’m the Good Cop” Award</strong>, sponsored by Delusion & Co.</p>
