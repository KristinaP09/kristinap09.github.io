        </header>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Raising a professional isn’t rocket science. It’s about integrity, respect, accountability, and the basic understanding that <span class="highlight">“professional”</span> means you don’t dump your responsibilities on others — especially not your students.</p>
            <p>But if you want to avoid raising a <span class="highlight">Chaoning Jr.</span>, the kind who turns unprofessionalism into an art form, here’s what <b>not</b> to do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Don’t delegate your core duties like interviewing candidates to a student without oversight — that’s not mentorship, that’s outsourcing your job.</li>
                <li>Don’t confuse casualness with professionalism. Being “friendly” doesn’t mean being dismissive or disrespectful.</li>
                <li>Don’t take credit for your students’ work and simultaneously deny them proper authorship. Spoiler: academia notices.</li>
                <li>Don’t assume your status grants you immunity from basic courtesy. Being “busy” is no excuse for poor communication.</li>
                <li>Respect everyone’s time, especially when recruiting talent. Asking “Are you available now?” without scheduling isn’t eagerness, it’s rudeness.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Real-World Example: The Interview Experience</h2>
            <blockquote>
                If you want a benchmark for professionalism, here’s a tip: Look beyond your own bubble. I’ve had the privilege of interviewing with top researchers and professors from Switzerland, Italy, and many other countries—people who value respect, clear communication, and proper procedures.
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduled meetings agreed upon days in advance, respecting everyone’s time zones and commitments</li>
                <li>Clear, courteous communication outlining the interview structure and participants</li>
                <li>Direct engagement with the principal investigator or relevant senior researchers, not offloading initial interviews to their students without explanation</li>
                <li>Transparent and fair discussions about contributions, authorship, and expectations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, compare that to the <span class="highlight">chaotic circus</span> I encountered in the lab of Prof. Chaoning Zhang, where the “professional” approach meant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending impromptu emails asking “Are you available now?” with no prior scheduling or respect for the candidate’s calendar</li>
                <li>Passing the entire interview process to a student, as if the candidate were just an inconvenient hurdle</li>
                <li>Defensive, tone-deaf replies masquerading as “eagerness” and “informality” — which in reality just erode the reputation of KAIST and UESTC</li>
                <li>Denying the candidate’s rightful recognition as first author, all while complaining about the “unprofessional” system they themselves perpetuate</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Let’s be clear:</b> This is not how top institutions conduct recruitment. This is how reputations get tarnished.</p>

            <h2>The Art of Accountability: Own Your Role, Don’t Pass the Buck</h2>
            <p>True professionals understand that leadership means leading, not delegating every important responsibility to others, especially your students. If you’re too busy or forgetful to manage interviews yourself, that’s a personal shortcoming — not a valid excuse to offload the task without transparency or respect.</p>
            <p>Passing candidates off to students without clear context is neither mentorship nor efficiency — it’s avoidance. It teaches your students to dodge responsibility and devalues their own professional growth by making them gatekeepers of frustration, rather than collaborators in meaningful research.</p>
            <p>If you want your lab to thrive, start by owning your duties as a professor, not passing the buck and expecting others to absorb the fallout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Respecting Authorship: Academic Integrity Isn’t Optional</h2>
            <p>In academia, authorship isn’t a mere formality—it’s a currency of respect, trust, and recognition for intellectual contributions. When senior researchers claim first authorship unjustly, it doesn’t just hurt the actual contributors — it undermines the entire institution’s credibility.</p>
            <p>Complaining about “unprofessional” practices in the system while perpetuating those same injustices yourself is hypocritical at best, and damaging at worst. If you want to be taken seriously as a leader and researcher, start by giving credit where credit is due.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Professionalism Is More Than Politeness — It’s Culture</h2>
            <p>Being “informal” and “friendly” is not an excuse for poor communication, lack of respect, or chaotic processes. True professionalism creates an environment where respect, clarity, and accountability are the norm, regardless of hierarchy or nationality.</p>
            <p>Institutions like KAIST and UESTC are renowned for their high standards—standards that demand more than excuses and “eagerness” emails sent without context. Upholding these standards is a collective responsibility that starts with professors, who set the tone for the entire lab.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Final Message to Prof. Chaoning Zhang</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Prof. Zhang,<br><br>
                Your recent conduct—passing interviews to students without clear context, dismissing rightful authorship credit, and conflating rudeness with enthusiasm—speaks volumes about your personal approach to professionalism. It is both ironic and telling that you simultaneously criticize the “system” you perpetuate.<br><br>
                While KAIST and UESTC stand as pillars of academic excellence, it’s unfortunate when individuals entrusted to uphold their reputations instead contribute to their erosion. True leadership means setting a standard worthy of those institutions, not undermining them through avoidable missteps.<br><br>
                If your management style truly values equality and friendship, remember that respect is earned through actions, not lip service. Your students deserve mentorship that empowers, not burdens, and candidates deserve courtesy that reflects the caliber of the institutions you represent.<br><br>
                May this be a learning moment — for you, your students, and the reputation of the labs you lead.
