## Latest Updates

---

### **Important Notice**

1. My <span style="color: red;"><strong>old personal webpages</strong></span>, previously hosted under two now-inaccessible GitHub accounts, are still viewable for archival purposes:
   - [patternkps.github.io](https://patternkps.github.io)
   - [kpnaga08.github.io/about/](https://kpnaga08.github.io/about/)

   For the most up-to-date content, please refer to this new website.

2. My previous email accounts are now **officially retired**:
   - Yahoo: <code style="color: red;">kristinasinaga57@yahoo.co.id</code>
   - Gmail: <code style="color: red;">krist.p.sinaga@gmail.com</code>

   Unfortunately, I forgot the passwords and couldn’t prove I’m me (apparently I’m suspicious—but in a cool way).

Stay tuned for a simplified explainer and blog post coming soon!
