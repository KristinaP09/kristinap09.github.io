1. My <code style="color : red">old personal webpages</code>, hosted via two forgotten and inaccessible GitHub accounts, <code style="color : magenta">are still viewable</code> [here](https://patternkps.github.io) and [here](https://kpnaga08.github.io/about/). For my latest work and updates, please continue browsing this new site.

2. My old Yahoo account (<code style="color : red">kristinasinaga57@yahoo.co.id</code>) and Gmail account (<code style="color : Orangered">krist.p.sinaga@gmail.com</code>) are <code style="color : Green">officially retired</code> -- I forgot my passwords, and apparently, I'm too suspicious to prove I'm me ðŸ˜‰.</p>

## <span style="color: #2FC10B;">Exciting News: New Publication in IEEE TPAMI!</span>
---

I am delighted to share my latest research, <span style="color: red;">"Federated Multi-View K-Means Clustering,"</span> recently published in the prestigious journal <span style="color: #1E7509;">[IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)</span>.

This paper introduces an innovative federated multi-view clustering algorithm designed to enhance scalable, decentralized AI applications. Our method effectively handles diverse and distributed data sources, addressing critical challenges such as privacy, computational efficiency, and robustness.

I am particularly proud of this work as it is significantly advances federated learning and clustering techniques, opening new avenues for trustworthy AI in cyber-physical systems and edge computing.
