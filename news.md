## <span style="color: blue;">[Update] New Blog Post</span>


I said coding would become accessible to everyone — no CS degree required — and now the world is catching up.  
My latest post dives into the rise of GitHub Copilot, the fall of gatekeeping, and the comedic beauty of watching the tech world panic.  
Read it here: [Copilot Chaos](./clown-network/chronicles/2025-4-29-copilot-chaos.html)

### <span style="color: red;">Notice</span>

1. My <code style="color : red">old personal webpages</code>—created long ago under two now-lost GitHub accounts—<code style="color : magenta">are still viewable</code>:
   - [patternkps.github.io](https://patternkps.github.io)
   - [kpnaga08.github.io/about](https://kpnaga08.github.io/about)

   But for everything current, shiny, and accurate, you’re already in the right place—this new site!

2. The following email accounts are now <code style="color : Fuchsia">officially retired</code>:
   - Yahoo: <code style="color: red;">kristinasinaga57@yahoo.co.id</code>  
   - Gmail: <code style="color: red;">krist.p.sinaga@gmail.com</code>

   I forgot the passwords (yes, both), and apparently I failed the “prove you’re not an impostor” tests. So long, legacy inboxes!

## <span style="color: #2FC10B;">Exciting News: New Publication in IEEE TPAMI!</span>

---

<p align="justify">
I’m absolutely thrilled to announce that my latest research paper,  
<span style="color: red;"><strong>“Federated Multi-View K-Means Clustering”</strong></span>,  
was recently published in the prestigious  
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34" style="color: #1E7509;"><strong>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025</strong></a>.

This work introduces a federated clustering framework tailored for multi-view, decentralized environments—where privacy matters, communication is limited, and chaos thrives. It bridges theory and practice in a beautifully noisy world.

A simplified blog post is in the works—because yes, you deserve an explanation that doesn’t sound like a conference talk at 8 a.m.

This page will serve as an evolving space for sharing major updates, surprising collaborations, small victories, and a sprinkle of rants (maybe). Expect a mix of academic milestones, research projects, and the occasional sarcastic commentary on the madness of tech life.
