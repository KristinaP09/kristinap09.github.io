## <span style="color: #2FC10B;">Exciting News: New Publication in IEEE TPAMI!</span>
---

I am delighted to share my latest research, "Federated Multi-View K-Means Clustering," recently published in the prestigious journal <span style="color: #1E7509;">[IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)</span>.

This paper introduces an innovative federated multi-view clustering algorithm designed to enhance scalable, decentralized AI applications. Our method effectively handles diverse and distributed data sources, addressing critical challenges such as privacy, computational efficiency, and robustness.

I am particularly proud of this work a it is significantly advances federated learning and clustering techniques, opening new avenues for trustworthy AI in cyber-physical systems and edge computing.
