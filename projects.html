  <h3 style="color: #ff99cc;">1. Multi-View Clustering Framework</h3>
  <p>
    Designed and implemented a modular, scalable framework for multi-view clustering algorithms.
    Built to support dynamic feature integration, interpretability, and performance tracking across federated environments.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #ff99cc;">2. Decentralized Anomaly Detection System</h3>
  <p>
    Led the development of a privacy-preserving anomaly detection model optimized for industrial edge devices. Deployed models across simulated sensor networks with minimal communication cost.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #ff99cc;">3. Clown Network Chronicles (Observational Series)</h3>
  <p>
    A satirical-analytical blog project that documents the absurdities of shared spaces, noise patterns, and unauthorized psychological phenomena through poetic sarcasm and digital logging.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #ff99cc;">4. Visualization of Federated Learning Topologies</h3>
  <p>
    Created animated visual models of peer-to-peer learning dynamics across edge devices, using real-time traffic simulation data and graph overlays.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color: #ff99cc;">5. Personal Website Infrastructure (2025)</h3>
  <p>
    Built and deployed a modular, animated personal homepage and blog system powered by GitHub Pages, HTML, inline SVG, sarcasm, and Inter font — featuring Clown-resistant logic and Möbius charm.
