  “Scalable. Interpretable. Trustworthy.”
</p>

<p>
My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, optimization, and systems theory — with a strong emphasis on clean design and explainability.  
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Multi-View Clustering:</strong> Developing efficient clustering algorithms that integrate heterogeneous feature spaces (views).</li>
  <li><strong>Federated Learning:</strong> Training models across distributed networks without compromising privacy or introducing chaos.</li>
  <li><strong>Edge AI:</strong> Designing lightweight models suitable for real-time, low-resource environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifying patterns that don’t belong — from machines to behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I value clarity in implementation and reproducibility in results. My research balances theoretical foundation with practical deployment —  
ensuring what I publish is not just elegant on paper, but robust in the real world.
