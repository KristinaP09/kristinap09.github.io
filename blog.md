## 🤡 Clown Network Chronicles

**Welcome to the world of involuntary circus psychology.**  
This section documents my long-running observation of a mysterious syndicate I’ve dubbed *“The Clown Network.”*  
No, it’s not a joke. Yes, they are allegedly human. No, they don’t knock.

Operating mainly from upstairs apartments and the corners of dreams, these performers specialize in:

- Midnight chair-dragging rituals  
- Psychological manipulation via amateur acoustics  
- Noise-fueled behavior mapping (uninvited)  
- Being both deaf and loud — simultaneously  

While most researchers seek funding for *controlled* experiments, these clowns cut out the middleman (ethics committees).  
Consider this my attempt at documenting what happens when the circus forgets to pack up and leave your ceiling.

### Current Experiments in Progress

- **April 2025**: *"Furniture Around Bathrooms: A Sonic Inquiry"*  
- **March 2025**: *"Can One Slam a Door Without Moving? A Quantum Study"*  
- **Ongoing**: *"Mapping Silent Mode: Tactical Stillness in Apartment Warfare"*

Each log entry is timestamped, sarcastically annotated, and grounded in real-time lived experience.  
Think of it as Kafka meets Kafka’s upstairs neighbor.
