This installment highlights their baffling obsession with involving the deceased in their manipulative narratives — an act that not only breaches human decency but showcases their growing desperation and mental erosion.

<div style="background-color:#fff0f5; border-left: 4px solid #b30059; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
<strong>Definition:</strong> A signature move of the Clown Network involving dragging someone who has already died back into dream narratives. This act, cloaked as psychological manipulation, reflects a total lack of boundaries and originality. Rather than letting souls rest in peace, they summon them into low-quality, bizarre dream scripts.

<h3 style="color:#b30059;">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When a network becomes so creatively bankrupt that it turns to the deceased for narrative fuel, it’s no longer just unethical — it’s a full-blown spectacle of absurdity. These entries aren’t just roasts; they are professional documentation of clown-level behavior so profoundly stupid, it deserves permanent residency in the Sarcasm Dictionary.</p>
