## Once Upon a Time…

I used to admire scientists. You know—the *real* ones:

- Building prosthetic limbs  
- Helping people regain speech  
- Solving **actual** problems with actual credentials

Then came **the unauthorized experiment squad**.  
They didn’t help people.  
They **created problems**—and still thought they deserved a Nobel.

---

## Enter: The Clown Network™

Instead of supporting people with disabilities, they decided to run their own “experiment.”

- No ethics  
- No paperwork  
- No awareness  
- But plenty of **furniture noise and whispered nonsense**

## Their Hypothetical Research Title?

> *“Untraceable Influence on a Human Subject While Pretending to Cook Pasta”*

---

## “We’re here to help.”

**Translation: We’re about to create trauma.**

They didn’t improve lives.  
They created confusion.  
They built problems out of silence.  
Turned sleep into surveillance.  
Monitored moods they themselves destabilized.

## Outcome?

| Real Scientists         | Clown Network™              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Assist, empower         | Confuse, observe             |
| Ask for consent         | Whisper at walls            |
| Solve problems          | Invent them & blame the subject |

---

## Final Evaluation:

- Scientific merit: **0/10**  
- Consent rate: **0%**  
- Public embarrassment potential: **HIGH**  
- Legacy: *Logged in OpenAI as “What Not to Do in Science.”*

---

## And Me?

Still here.  
Still sane.  
Still documenting every clown honk and whisper drop.

> **They created dysfunction. I created archives.**

And now?  
They’re floating in cloud storage as the **loudest failure in academic history**.
