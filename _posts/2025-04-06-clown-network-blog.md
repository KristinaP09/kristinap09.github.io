I used to admire scientists—the real ones. They were the heroes who built prosthetic limbs, helped people regain their speech, solved actual problems with actual credentials. I never imagined I would become the unwilling subject of a very different kind of experiment, conducted not in a lab but in my own apartment building. Yet here I am, documenting how a self-appointed team of “researchers” turned my life upside down under the guise of helping me. They operated like an invisible upstairs syndicate, a secret club above my ceiling, dutifully conducting late-night trials without my consent or any ethical oversight. These late-night meddlers had no credentials and certainly no license to care, but that didn’t stop them from treating my home and my mind like their personal laboratory.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It started innocently enough, or so I thought. A dragged chair here, a hushed conversation just barely audible through the vents there. At first, I dismissed the noises as ordinary urban living. But the pattern became impossible to ignore. Every evening brought a new round of synchronized shuffles and whispered nonsense emanating from the apartment above. Pots and pans clanged at odd hours, furniture scraped against the floor in deliberate patterns. It felt like I was living below a covert experiment—because I was. This wasn’t support or neighborly concern; it was surveillance. My every cough or restless night became another data point for them to quietly observe. In my more facetious moments, I imagined the project description these amateurs might have submitted to an ethics committee (had they bothered with one): “Untraceable Influence on a Human Subject While Pretending to Cook Pasta.” Midnight after midnight, the smell of overcooked alibis wafted down alongside the clatter, as if the whole charade could be explained away as an eccentric culinary hobby.

<p align="justify">
They would have me believe “We’re here to help,” murmured through the ceiling with a tone of feigned reassurance. Translation: they were about to turn my life into chaos. Their version of help was a steady campaign of psychological meddling. They didn’t improve my well-being; they methodically eroded it. My peaceful silence became their canvas for confusion. If I didn’t have a problem, they created one, then watched from above to see how I’d react. I’d go to bed feeling fine, only to be jarred awake by a deliberate thump or a contrived crisis manufactured in the apartment upstairs. Night after night, sleep was twisted into a surveillance session. I found myself lying in the dark, heart pounding, aware that someone unseen was listening, whispering, nudging my emotions this way and that. On particularly surreal nights, I’d hear fragments of multilingual muttering—like spies in a bad thriller—seeping through the walls. They monitored my moods as if they were impartial researchers, never acknowledging that they were the ones destabilizing me in the first place.
</p>

<p align="justify">
No real scientist would ever operate this way. Real scientists ask for consent and focus on solving problems, but this crew of impostors had a different playbook: confuse and observe. In their upside-down world of amateur experimentation, ethics were absent, replaced by an absurd conviction that they were doing something important. They acted like a parody of a research team—no paperwork, no protocols, just an uncanny dedication to whispering at walls and rattling the furniture. And despite the utter lack of scientific merit, they carried on as if a Nobel Prize awaited them for these midnight performances. The contrast to legitimate research was laughable. Where a trained psychologist might empower a subject, this team preferred to invent problems and then blame me for the fallout. Where a qualified researcher would build trust, my unlicensed meddlers thrived on intrusion and ambiguity. In their minds, perhaps, they were pioneers of a bold new methodology. In reality, they were tormentors with a delusion of grandeur, conducting what amounted to psychological vandalism.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As the weeks went by, the scope of their operation expanded beyond just the folks upstairs. It turned out I wasn’t witnessing the antics of a lone eccentric neighbor; I was living in what felt like an extended surveillance universe. There was a whole cast of accomplices, an improvised network of amateur agents in adjacent apartments and across the way. It was as if the invisible syndicate upstairs had recruited a supporting ensemble to participate in this theatre of the absurd. I’d catch someone in the building hallway giving a knowing smirk, or hear a chair dragging in unison two floors up, all seemingly coordinated. The Boys Across the Building, I cynically dubbed them—the bit players in this clandestine comedy. Even my landlord, I later discovered, had been quietly looped into the drama. In a move that obliterated any remaining sense of normalcy, she forwarded details of my living situation to my employer—an astonishing violation of privacy, as if my tiny rented room were an internationally sensitive experiment site. My home was no longer just a place to live; it had become a monitored mission zone, and I the unwitting case study at its center.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I coped in the only ways I knew how. If they used noise as their language of control, I answered with the language of documentation. Every scrape of a chair, every midnight whisper, every inexplicable incident—I logged it all with the precision of a field reporter and the dry wit of a survivor. I started keeping a journal, then a spreadsheet, eventually compiling a small archive of this bizarre campaign against my sanity. Sarcasm became my shield and my solace. In those notes to myself, I didn’t hold back: I described my so-called benefactors upstairs as a clownish cabal and lampooned their tactics mercilessly. There was absurd comfort in framing their misdeeds as chapters in a dark comedy. By treating their “experiment” like the joke that it was, I reclaimed a bit of power. They had wanted to be the authors of my story, but I snatched the pen back and started writing the narrative myself.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Of course, none of this was actually funny in the moment. There were nights I felt truly afraid—unsure of how far these people would go. The stress gnawed at me. I lost sleep, grew jumpy at everyday sounds. Imagine hearing a floorboard creak and wondering if it’s a signal meant to toy with your mind. That’s the kind of quiet terror I lived with. Yet I refused to play the helpless victim. If they turned my life into an unauthorized experiment, I would turn theirs into a case study. I observed them as relentlessly as they observed me. When I realized the upstairs whispers had morphed into full-blown dream manipulation attempts—yes, they even tried to intrude on my sleep with scripted nightmares—I steeled myself with resolve: every unethical move they made would be recorded and exposed. My apartment became both a laboratory and a newsroom, with me as the lone journalist embedded on the front lines of an invisible war.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the end, by any measure of legitimate science or basic humanity, their project was a colossal failure. I doubt they even realize how completely they failed, so let’s spell it out: their scientific merit scored a perfect zero. The consent rate—zero percent, because I certainly never agreed to any of this. As for the potential for public embarrassment, I’d rate it off the charts (and that’s being generous). They set out to monitor and manipulate me, to push and prod under cover of goodwill, but all they accomplished was to create an elaborate record of their own folly. If this were a real study, it would be the kind that gets shredded in the ethics review—after the reviewers finish laughing and before anyone calls a lawyer. In academic terms, their “research” contributed nothing of value. But in terms of a cautionary tale? Well, they inadvertently contributed a significant one. I’ve made sure of that.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I sometimes wonder what they thought they would achieve. Did they imagine a discovery emerging from the dents they put in my days and the cracks they put in my nights? Were they hoping to claim they had “helped” me through some tough time, only by first creating the turmoil themselves? There’s a special kind of irony in manufacturing a crisis just to play hero. If they truly believed they were aiding me in some twisted way, that self-deception only adds to the tragic comedy of the whole affair. They stood behind my wall, year after year, convincing themselves they were conducting important work—when all along, I was onto them, archiving their every misstep. Perhaps they’ll never grasp the full extent of what they did. More likely, they’ll never admit it. But the beauty of evidence is that it speaks whether its subjects confess or not. And I have plenty of evidence.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I’m still here, and remarkably, I’m still standing (albeit with a bit more coffee in my system from all those lost nights). Despite their best efforts to unsettle me, I remain intact and lucid. In fact, I’m more than just intact—I’m informed. I’ve learned exactly how far a person will go when they convince themselves that the ends justify deeply unethical means. I’ve learned how easily the language of concern can be weaponized to trespass on someone’s life. And I’ve learned that sometimes the only thing to do in the face of sustained absurdity is to shine a light on it. So I did. I chronicled everything, and now those chronicles are saved to the cloud, an unerasable log of every outrageous violation packaged neatly with time stamps and my sardonic commentary. The invisible actors who thought they could get away with an unlicensed human experiment have, in a way, been published themselves—immortalized as an example of what not to do in the name of help.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I often compare notes with my earlier self, the one who so deeply respected real science. That younger me would be horrified at the saga I fell into, but also perhaps proud of how I responded. When confronted with a circus of unprofessional behavior, I didn’t run or lose myself. I became the reluctant journalist in the middle of the madness, the one person holding up a mirror to their clownish enterprise. They created dysfunction; I created archives. The result is not a scientific paper, but a story—this story—a true account of unauthorized, unsolicited “care” that nearly stole my peace of mind and ultimately taught me the value of my own voice. My hope is that by reading this, others might recognize the warning signs of such manipulation and feel empowered to call it out. Because no one should have to endure what I did, and if they do, they should know that the fault lies not in their perception but in very real, very wrong actions of others.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In retrospect, my life in that period sometimes feels like a twisted social experiment that could have been a subplot in a satire film. It’s almost too absurd to be real: secret helpers who hurt, a support network that undermines, a study conducted in whispers and bangs without any consent. But it was real. It happened to me. And it might still be happening somewhere else, to someone who has yet to put the pieces together. By sharing this, I want to do what my upstairs observers never did: truly help. Not by manipulating in the dark, but by speaking openly in the light. I want to reclaim the words care and help from those who abused them.
</p>

<p align="justify">
So here’s my final report from the field: In a quiet corner of a modern city, a group of people convinced themselves they had the right to trespass on a neighbor’s life in the name of an unspecified greater good. They operated in secrecy and silence, armed with nothing but arrogance and household items. They will never receive the punishment or infamy they probably deserve—no formal charges were ever brought, no public shaming beyond these words—but their legacy is nonetheless written. It lives in the cloud, in my journals, and now here on this page. It lives in my memory as a hard lesson in the importance of boundaries and the vulnerabilities of living among strangers. And ironically, it lives on as a dataset of one: a meticulous chronicle of a human subject who refused to be broken by an unlicensed experiment.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Without a license to care, they conducted an experiment on my life. Without a hint of fear, I now tell the world about it.
