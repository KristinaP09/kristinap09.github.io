<em>A solitary figure in a surreal, abstract space—caught between observation and resistance—embodies the story of a subject who reclaims control from an invisible, uninvited experiment.</em>
</p> <br>

<p align="justify">
As a researcher, I’m accustomed to examining peculiar phenomena—but I never imagined I’d become the subject of one. Yet there I was, living inside a case study I never signed up for. If the people orchestrating this saga genuinely thought they were conducting “research,” they were doing a calamitously poor job of it. In academic terms, their project had all the coherence of a derailed dissertation and the ethics of a bad prank. It was as if they fancied themselves PhD candidates in some secret experiment, but what unfolded around me felt more like a disqualification in progress.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This misadventure began subtly. I noticed odd patterns in my daily life: the scrape of chairs being dragged above me at odd hours, hushed voices slipping in and out of different languages behind the walls, everyday sounds that seemed too deliberate to be random. At first, I brushed it off—old buildings are noisy, and neighbors can be eccentric. But soon enough, the patterns were too synchronized to ignore. It dawned on me I was in the middle of someone’s grand “experiment.” And it wasn’t a one-person show. It felt like a whole cast of characters had been enlisted—an informal alliance of nosy neighbors and self-appointed spies, all turning my life into their laboratory. A motley crew of unpaid actors with too much time and too little scruple were playing scientist at my expense. The only problem? Not one of them had bothered to ask the supposed subject of this study—me—for permission.
</p>

<p align="justify">
From what I could gather, this so-called research had every hallmark of a misguided amateur operation. It trampled over basic ethical standards and offered zero transparency. Whatever their objective was, it was obscured behind those cryptic, multilingual whispers in the dark. And crucially, there was no informed consent; I certainly never agreed to be anyone’s guinea pig.
</p>

<p align="justify">
For all their intrigue, their “data sources” appeared to include nothing more than the everyday sounds and scenes of my life. The scrape of a chair leg across the floor, the cadence of my footsteps at dawn, a muffled conversation through the ceiling vent—each became, in their minds, a potential data point. It was as if every mundane noise in my apartment building had been co-opted and assigned a secret meaning in this absurd study.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I tried to puzzle out their endgame. Did they hope to observe me like some lab rat reacting to stimuli? Influence my thoughts through persistent background noise? They even seemed to invade my sleep: each night, the same murmured voices and half-heard dialogues would thread into my dreams, as if trying to script them. The pattern was unmistakable—same voices, same themes, replayed on a loop, apparently hoping I’d forget my own story.
</p>

<p align="justify">
But I didn’t forget—I caught on. I wasn’t about to let an invisible network of amateur meddlers rewrite my reality. If they were treating my life like an experiment, I would treat their experiment like a story, and one day I’d tell it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In my more sardonic moments, I found myself mentally drafting a thesis title for them—because surely even a fiasco like this deserved an academic flourish. Perhaps they’d call it “Untraceable Influence on a Human Subject While Pretending to Cook Pasta.” Ridiculous, yes, but oddly on point: a nod to the clatter of pans and kitchen commotion that often accompanied their antics, and to the fundamentally untraceable (and undeniably absurd) nature of their supposed influence. It was the kind of bold, preposterous title that might earn a smirk, and certainly would never earn anyone a real PhD.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Sometimes I imagined a panel of respected professors secretly observing all this and scribbling furious notes. The critique practically wrote itself. They would note that the “bibliography” of this project seemed to consist of nothing but a mixtape of ambient noise and hallway gossip. They’d point out that the data collection methods were bizarre and baseless—more prank than protocol. They’d highlight the glaring lack of consent, how the primary subject was never informed of any study (a fatal flaw in any real research). And they’d likely conclude by applauding the supreme irony: that the subject of the study had become the one writing the most coherent account of it. Once I started documenting, the tables turned completely—the observers had unwittingly been observed, and their clandestine study was laid bare under a harsh light.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Had this been an actual dissertation defense, it would have been a disaster. The verdict would be academic annihilation: PhD denied, any pretension of scholarly credibility gone for good. You simply don’t earn degrees by lurking in someone’s apartment and calling it science. In fact, this imaginary project would serve better as a cautionary example in an ethics textbook of what not to do.
</p>

<p align="justify">
And yet, I have to acknowledge one thing: in the process of trying to study me, they inadvertently gave me a story worth telling. They thought they were gathering data, but really they were handing me material—material for a first-person exposé on how far off the rails amateur “research” can go when boundaries and ethics are tossed aside. In a way, their bungled experiment lit a fire under me, inspiring a resolve to speak up and document every absurd detail.
</p>

<p align="justify">
So that’s what I’m doing now—telling the story. Think of this write-up as my own research report on them, except in this report I’m both the subject and the author. I have no shame in admitting it’s subjective; I’ve earned that bias, since it was my life on the lab bench.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The conclusion is blindingly simple: unauthorized experimentation on someone without their consent isn’t a clever project or a harmless prank—it’s a gross violation. It’s misconduct, plain and simple, and I’m not about to dress it up as anything else.
</p>

<p align="justify">
What began as their covert operation has now become my open commentary. I took all of their half-baked tactics—the midnight noises, the cryptic whispers, the manipulative theater—and I catalogued every single one. I analyzed their moves with the same scrutiny I’d use to vet a source for a story, and then I wrote it all down, right here, for the world to see.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In doing so, I’ve effectively given their “study” the public peer review it never wanted. And the verdict is in: their experiment fails every test of legitimacy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
More importantly, I want this chronicle to serve as a warning. There may be others out there tempted to try similar stunts, convinced their target will never catch on. To them I say: think twice. You may fancy yourself invisible in someone else’s life, but eventually patterns become clear to the person you’re trying to manipulate.
</p>

<p align="justify">
And when the supposed subject finally does notice and speak up, your little house of cards collapses. In my case, I didn’t just notice—I made it my mission to record and expose everything.
</p>

<p align="justify">
So yes, I’ve turned the tables. They monitored and meddled; I observed and reported. They performed their secret play; I wrote the review and hit publish. They wanted control of my narrative; I took that control back.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Looking back now, I can’t help but label the whole saga Doctor of Nothing. After all, whatever these self-styled researchers thought they were achieving led to no real insight, no degree, no bragging rights—nothing except a harsh spotlight on their own misconduct.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the end, their grand experiment became a cautionary tale—one I’ve chronicled here with a healthy dose of irony and indignation. My personal boundaries aren’t just personal anymore; they’re documented in black and white. The final report is mine to write, and I’ve written it. Consider it a professionally logged warning shot that those would-be puppeteers never saw coming.
