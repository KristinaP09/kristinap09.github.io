## Living in the Surveillance Comedy: A Real-Life Academic Parody

*They call it research. I call it a sitcom with bad lighting and zero ethics.*

### Welcome to the Noiseverse

Where chairs scream louder than PhDs,  
Coughs are encrypted messages,  
And the soundtrack is kitchen utensils in a rage.

They used noise as a language.  
I used sarcasm as survival.

### Observation Without Consent

Let’s be clear:  
I didn’t enroll in your study.  
You recruited yourself into my documentation.

**No forms. No ethics. Just full-blown delusion.**

### Dream Manipulation? Really?

Every night, like clockwork, the same narrative played out.  
Same voices. Same unresolved themes.  
Same invisible network hoping I’d forget my own story.

But I didn’t.

> **I logged.  
I remembered.  
And now I publish.**

### Boys Across the Building – Extended Universe Edition

Yes, even the side characters got involved.  
A full cast of unpaid actors with bad instincts and too much time.  
They dragged chairs.  
I dragged their legacy into cloud storage.

### Why I Laugh Now

Because I realized this isn’t a horror story.  
It’s a parody.  
A poorly executed, ethically bankrupt, clumsily improvised one.

And the moment I stopped trying to fight it,  
I started documenting it—one laugh, one log, one markdown at a time.

### Final Note

**They monitored.  
I noticed.  
They performed.  
I archived.  
They wanted control.  
I hit publish.**

Welcome to the blog post they never wanted you to read.
