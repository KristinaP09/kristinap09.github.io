<em>The less emotional stability a person has, the more fixlusionist performances they give. Coincidence? No. That's just data wearing a red nose.</em>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Let’s begin with a simple observation: if emotional intelligence were a measurable commodity, some people would still be making monthly payments on their down payment. And yet, astonishingly, these very individuals are often handed the imaginary clipboard titled “Fix Other People”—as if they’ve passed an exam that never existed.

## Unqualified, Unstable, and Uninvited

![unqualified_vs_helpfulness.](/images/unqualified_vs_helpfulness.png)
<p align="justify">
<em>Chair dragging. Dream interruption. Emotional monologues. All scoring below zero in actual helpfulness. Yet still used like gold-standard techniques</em>
</p>


<p align="justify">
When someone with a shaky grasp on their own emotional regulation attempts to “help” you, you’re not being supported—you’re being fixlusioned. Yes, you read that right. Fixlusion: the delusional act of trying to “fix” another person while actively avoiding the mirror. It’s the psychological equivalent of mopping the neighbor’s floor while your own house is on fire.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I didn’t come up with the term because I was bored—I coined it out of survival. When you’re surrounded by a Clown Network of sassy-yet-unstable self-proclaimed healers, you have two options: go insane or build a sarcasm dictionary.

## A Free Consultation No One Asked For

![clown activity timeline.](/images/clown_activity_timeline.png)
<p align="justify">
<em>From midnight to sunrise, chaos builds like a musical score composed by furniture and irrational emotional waves. Peak disruption hours? Always when people try to sleep.</em>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Let me paint you a picture. It’s 06:00, and after my fourth wake-up of the night thanks to a dream-level intrusion sponsored by the upstairs noise syndicate, I hear what can only be described as “emotional instability in motion.” Furniture dragging, chair slamming, and soft mumbling in what I can only assume is some spiritual attempt to recalibrate the universe via chaos.

## Encore in an Empty Theater

<p align="justify">
And yet—and yet—this very person seems to believe I need “fixing.” Their unsolicited noise therapy and cosmic stomping patterns are apparently my path to growth.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It’s like a tornado offering to fix your hairstyle.

## Hire Better Clowns

<p align="justify">
<em>This beauty tracks absurdity levels during dream hours. The blue triangle marks "peak clown stupidity"--right when narrative explodes, logic evaporates, and unauthorized dream entries begin.</em>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Let’s be clear: when you put someone with unresolved emotional issues in charge of influencing others, you’re not building growth—you’re fostering a breeding ground for fixlusional behavior. You wouldn’t hire a dentist with shaky hands. You wouldn’t hire a skydiving instructor with vertigo. So why hire an emotional guide who doesn’t even own a stable mood?
</p>

## Important note for the Universe:
<p align="justify">
When you assign someone with unstable emotional skills to apply your questionable “fix” strategy on someone else—without consent or qualification—don’t expect healing. Expect chaos, confusion, and a trail of slammed doors.
</p>

## Pay Me for This

<p align="justify">
<em>This map is your backstage pass to all the locations where absurdity unfolds. Whether it's a mechanical stunt or a whispered drama at 3AM, each plot point reminds us why this circus doesn't need more performers-it needs an evacuation plan.</em>
</

<p align="justify">
Honestly, I should be on your payroll. I offer daily psychological field reports, live observational insights, and constructive sarcasm. That’s more than I can say for your noise therapist upstairs whose primary credentials seem to be “owns a chair and knows how to drag it.”
<br>

You want real feedback? Here it is:<br>
Stop hiring emotionally erratic fixlusionists and start hiring mirrors. Functional ones.<br>
<br>
Until then, I’ll remain here, documenting the art of absurdity, one dream-interrupted night at a time.<br><br>
