  “A mind wired for patterns. A soul allergic to nonsense.”
</p>

<p>
I’m **Kristina P. Sinaga** — a lifelong learner, researcher, and sarcastic observer of systems and chaos. I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU), Taiwan, and I’m passionate about crafting intelligent AI solutions that not only work — but make sense.
</p>

<p>
My journey is shaped by clarity, structure, and a strong sense of identity in everything I build. Whether it’s an algorithm or a sentence, I believe in getting things right with purpose. You’ll often find my work bridging theory and practice, infused with wit, and wrapped in elegant logic.
</p>

<p>
I specialize in **clustering**, **multi-view learning**, **federated learning**, and **Edge AI**—especially in the unpredictable, real-world settings where systems are truly tested. My work blends theoretical rigor with hands-on experimentation to build scalable, intelligent solutions that hold up beyond the lab.
</p>

<p>
I’ve designed algorithms for cyber-physical systems, examined robustness under noise and manipulation, and explored how machine learning interacts with flawed human environments. This curiosity also sparked **NeuralGlow.ai**—a satirical AI lab where humor, critique, and product design converge to challenge hype culture and reimagine how we build intelligent systems.
</p>

<p>
When I’m not pushing boundaries in AI and clustering, I document absurd patterns in daily life—from machine noise to meta-satire. This page is my hub for sharing, reflecting, and exploring the intersection of technology, clarity, and carefully contained chaos.
</p>

<p>
I’m currently on the global job market for research-driven or applied roles—starting **October 2025**—with teams that value clarity, autonomy, and creative rigor. If your work is serious about outcomes (and allergic to nonsense too), let’s talk.
