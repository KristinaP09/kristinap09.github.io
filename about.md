Iâ€™m a researcher specializing in **machine learning, clustering algorithms, multi-view learning, and Edge AI**. I hold a Ph.D. in **Appliedd Mathematics** from [Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU), Taiwan](https://eng.cycu.edu.tw). My research focuses on developing **trustworthy AI methods for distributed and resource-constrained environments**, including federated learning and Edge AI. My work integrates **theoretical foundations** (clustering, optimization, statistical learning) with **practical applications** (anomaly detection, decentralized AI, and industrual edge computing).

I have held reserach positions at the [Institute of Information Science and Technologies "Alessandro Faedo", Italian National Research Council (ISTI-CNR)](https://www.isti.cnr.it/en/), [CYCU (Taiwan)](https://eng.cycu.edu.tw), and [BINUS University (Indonesia)](https://binus.ac.id), where I developed and validated novel AI models for **efficient, scalable, and interpretable clustering**. My expertise aligns closely with **trustworthiness assurance, Edge AI, and Industrial edge applications**, making me well-suited for roles in **academia and industru-driven AI research**.
