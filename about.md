<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2.2em;">About Me</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; color: #ff99cc;">
  “A mind wired for patterns. A soul allergic to nonsense.”
</p>

<p>
I’m Kristina P. Sinaga — a lifelong learner, researcher, and sarcastic observer of systems and chaos.  
I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU), Taiwan, and I’m passionate about crafting intelligent AI solutions that not only work — but make sense.  
My journey is shaped by clarity, structure, and a strong sense of identity in everything I build. Whether it's an algorithm or a sentence, I believe in getting things right with purpose.

<p>
You’ll often find my work bridging theory and practice, infused with wit, and wrapped in elegant logic.  
When I’m not pushing boundaries in AI and clustering, I blog about absurd patterns in daily life — from machine noise to meta-satire.  
</p>

<p>
This page is my hub for sharing, reflecting, and documenting the intersection of technology, clarity, and carefully contained chaos.
